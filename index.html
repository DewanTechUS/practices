    <em>Right now, I am training with 
    <a href="https://perscholas.org/" > Per Scholas</a> in MERN Full Stack Development — 
    learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB. 
    I practice Git and GitHub daily, and I share my progress here.</em>
</p>

<p>
    Before joining Per Scholas,
   I have worked in QA testing, postal retail management, IT support, and even started two companies in Bangladesh — 
    one in film technology and one in computer training. 
    These experiences taught me teamwork, leadership, and technical skills.
</p>

 Skills I use: QA Testing, Selenium, Postman, JIRA, Visual Studio Code, Windows, macOS, Linux, PC Repair, Networking.
 What I believe: Every mistake is a lesson. Every commit is a step forward. I will keep learning and growing until I become one of the best developers I can be.
