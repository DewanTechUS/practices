      This is really cool! I'm bulding a web page!
      </h1>
      <p>
       My name is Dewan Mahmud Rocky, and I am learning Git and GitHub.
       I am building web pages, and this makes me proud and happy.
       I practice every day, and I can see myself improving step by step.
       I will keep learning and grow into an advanced developer over time.

       Sometimes I make mistakes, but every mistake helps me become stronger.
       Each commit I make is another step forward in my journey as a developer.
       I feel proud when I push my code to GitHub and share my work online.
       I know that practice will help me improve faster and reach greater goals.

       I believe in myself and in my future.
       Dewan Mahmud Rocky is becoming better with every project I complete.
       One day soon, I will be a great developer and achieve my dreams.
       I will keep pushing forward until I become one of the best.

<h1>What I Will Learn in My MERN Full-Stack Journey</h1>
ðŸŸ¢ Web Foundations
HTML builds the structure of a page.

APIs create endpoints for the frontend to use.
Authentication protects data with login and logout.

MongoDB stores data in documents.
Mongoose builds schemas and models for MongoDB.
CRUD lets me create, read, update, and delete information.
ðŸŸ¢  Tools & Workflow
Git and GitHub track my changes and help me work with others.
NPM installs packages and libraries.
Testing checks if my code works with Jest or React Testing Library.
