     <p>Before joining Per Scholas,
        I have worked in QA testing,<span class="accent-color"> postal retail management, IT support,</span> and even started two companies in Bangladesh — 
        one in film technology and one in computer training. 
        These experiences taught me teamwork, leadership, and technical skills. </p>

    <p>Life is a continuous journey of learning and growth, <spam class="highlight">where every experience—whether good or bad—teaches us something valuable.</spam> Challenges may feel overwhelming in the moment, but they often shape our strength, patience, and resilience.<span class="highlight"> At the same time, moments of success remind us of the importance of hard work and determination</span>. <span class="accent-color">By staying focused, positive, and open to new opportunities,</span> we can keep moving forward and build the future we want for ourselves.</p>
