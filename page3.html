    <p>Before joining Per Scholas,
   I have worked in QA testing,<span> postal retail management, IT support,</span> and even started two companies in Bangladesh â€” 
    one in film technology and one in computer training. 
    These experiences taught me teamwork, leadership, and technical skills. </p>
